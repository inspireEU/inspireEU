### Hello!

My name is max (previously INSPIRE, now m1.ins), and I am a 23 year old Computer science student based in Glasgow, Scotland. 🌍

I have a passion for web automation, data handling + web scraping, while also having a curious interest in Artificial intelligence and Reverse Engineering. 🛸

I mainly code in Golang, but have experience in HTML, CSS, Node.js, Vanilla Javascript, Java, Python, and C. 🔥

I am looking for projects to add to my portfolio, if you have any suggestions please message me on discord @m1.ins ! ❤️
