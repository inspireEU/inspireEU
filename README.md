### Hello! 💧

My name is INSPIRE (or max), and I am a 20 year old Computer science student based in Glasgow, Scotland. 🌍

I have a passion for web automation, data handling + web scraping, while also having a curious interest in Artificial intelligence and Reverse Engineering. 🛸

I mainly code in Node.JS, Vanilla JavaScript, and Python. I would love to eventually learn and work with TypeScript and Golang. 🔥

I am looking for projects to add to my portfolio, if you have any suggestions please message me on discord @INSPIRE#0001 ! ❤️
